# A* algorithm
Reaching a destination via the shortest route is a daily activity we all do. A-star (also referred to as A*) is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest
path between nodes or graphs. It is an informed search algorithm, as it uses information about path cost and also uses heuristics to find the solution.

# To run this

1 - First left click on grid makes a start node

2 - Second left click on gird makes destination or end node

3 - the thrid left click or clicks would make a barriers on grid
